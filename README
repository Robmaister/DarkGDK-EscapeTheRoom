This is the result of about 2 1/2 days of my work at the Digital Media Academy 
Game Programming with C++ course. Originally compiled very well on Visual 
Studio 2008, I've tried to recompile it for Visual Studio 2010, but I've run 
into many errors on the way that involve things like compiling parts of the 
Windows SDK, installing two copies of the DirectX SDK and overwriting some of 
the new files with the older ones and modifying Dark GDK itself. At this point 
my code is up here simply for review/showcasing/backup. If someone finds a way 
of getting DarkGDK projects to compile in Visual Studio 2010, I'll gladly pull 
the changes.
